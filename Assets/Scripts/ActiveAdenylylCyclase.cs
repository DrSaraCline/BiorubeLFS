/*  File:       ActiveAdenylylCyclase
    Purpose:    The active Adenylyl Cyclase is connected to the Trimeric
                G-Protein's Alpha subunit. It converts ATP into cAMP.
                This file is connected to the Active version of the Prefab,
                which is instantiated when the Alpha subunit collides with the
                inactive Adenylyl Cyclase.
                This file provides the functions that allow the Active Adenylyl
                Cyclase to turn ATP into cAMP
