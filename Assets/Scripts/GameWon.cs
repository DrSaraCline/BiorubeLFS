/*  File:       GameWon
    Purpose:    the game contains a number of checkboxes. When all the check
                boxes have been checked and there are no unchecked boxes remaining,
                the level has been won. Each checkbox is initialized with a tag
                and is unchecked. When the condition is reached, such as the
                Alpha subunit Bindint to the Adenylyl Cyclase, the tag is removed
                from the checkbox. This causes the checkbox to actually become
                checked. To add a new win checkbox, an unchecked Win checkbox
                Prefab is dragged onto the Game's surface. The Prefab is then
                renamed and given a new Tag. This tag needs to be added to the
                array defined in this file.
